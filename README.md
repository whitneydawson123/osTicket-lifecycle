I opened up the ticket that the entire mobile banking is down. I started the process by setting the SLA to SLA-A. I changed the department of the ticket from support to system administrators. Then I changed the priority from normal to emergency.

Jane is collaborating with Jerry from Systems Engineering and he found the issue and corrected it. So she set the ticket as resolved.
